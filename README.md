Javascript implementations of common algorithms and data-structures, many of which are discussed in *[Princeton's 'Algorithms, Part I'](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)* and *['Part II'](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)* courses on Coursera.

'This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.'
